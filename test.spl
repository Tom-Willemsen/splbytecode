[Enter Hamlet and Romeo]
Hamlet: You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted coward!
Hamlet: You are as stupid as the difference between a handsome rich brave hero and thyself!
Hamlet: Speak your mind!
Hamlet: You are as brave as the sum of your fat little stuffed misused dusty old rotten codpiece and a beautiful fair warm peaceful sunny summer's day.
Hamlet: You are as healthy as the difference between the sum of the sweetest reddest rose and my father and yourself!
Hamlet: Speak your mind!
Hamlet: You are as cowardly as the sum of yourself and the difference between a big mighty proud kingdom and a horse.
Hamlet: Speak your mind.
Hamlet: Speak your mind!
